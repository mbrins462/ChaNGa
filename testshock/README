This is a simple test of SPH done by running a shock tube and comparing
the results with a previous SPH calculation.

Running "make test" should 1) run ChaNGa on a test simulation and 2) run
a simple analysis to produce the pressure versus position in the shock tube.

Files in this directory include:

pressplot.c: a simple analysis program
tipsydefs.h: header for the above program
shocktube.std: Initial conditions for the shock tube.
shocktube.param: Parameter file for the shock tube simulation.
press_gasoline.out: benchmark output from Gasoline for comparison.
