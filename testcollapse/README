This directory contains a test of the collapse of a self-gravitation
adiabatic sphere of gas.  As the gas collapses, a spherical accretion
shock forms and grows. This test takes about 7 minutes on a 2007 era
dual core processor.

This test investigates whether gravity and gas dynamics are both working
properly.  Type "make test" to perform the test.   This runs a
simulation and uses "tipsy" to get a spherically averaged profile of gas
quantities on the final step.  Hence tipsy needs to be installed to
complete this test.  A comparison from gasoline in in "gas.prof".
"prof.py" is a matplotlib python script which will graphically compare
the results.
