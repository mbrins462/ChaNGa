This directory contains a program to generate an arbitary size input
file to test ChaNGa performance.  The data generated will will be a
Poisson distribution of particles in a cubical volume, and the
parameter file will have ChaNGa integrate this as a cosmological
simulation.  Note that unless you are living before 1982, this volume
is not a representation of a realistic cosmological model.

Usage:

The size of the data is set by the value of the "N" variable in the
Makefile.  The dataset can be created by typing "make", which creates
the particle data in the file "testdata.tbin".  "testdata.param" can
then be used as an argument to ChaNGa to run a simulation based on the
dataset.  I.e. "charmrun +p 2 ChaNGa testdata.param".  A value of
100000 for N takes about a minute to calculate gravity on a GHz class
processor.

For testing SPH, 'pgaspart' produces a similar cube of gas.  Again,
unless you are living before 1980, this would not be a reasonable
cosmology.
