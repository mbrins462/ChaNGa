	* ParallelGravity.cpp : Checkpointing seems to work now.  Also
	added an "STOP" file option (create a file called "STOP" to stop a
	running simulation) and a "-wall" option (specify wall clock time
	of simulation).

	* MultipoleMoments.h, Ewald.C, ParallelGravity.h, TreePiece.cpp,
	moments.c, moments.h: Implemented HEXADECAPOLE forces.  Forces seem
	to be accurate, but it's not good enough for production because I'm
	WAY to conservative in handling softening.
